Constructed derivative diagnostic plots for drawdown well testing to identify flow regimes, analyze reservoir behavior, and improve interpretation accuracy.

Estimated key reservoir properties — wellbore storage constant, permeability, skin factor, drainage area, and Dietz factor — from derivative plot evaluation.

Derived fault presence, distance, and orientation from derivative plot analysis, supporting precise reservoir characterization and field development planning.
